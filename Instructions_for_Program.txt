Program 1: Contruction_Psychor_chart_MATLAB - This is the main code necessary for plotting the psychrometric chart
fullfig - a function called by the Contruction_Psychor_chart_MATLAB for full  view of psychrometric chart. Available in 
MATLAB file exchange https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48071-fullfig
- After running the code (Contruction_Psychor_chart_MATLAB.m), wait till all the necessary figures and plots are generated (6 figures). 
- For your reference, the same generated figures from this code are exported as .jpg files in the folder after the 
code runs, which can be seen for a clear view. 

Program 2: Saturation_press_deviations 
This code is required to calculate the saturation vapour pressure of water from ASHRAE table and an empirical correlation. The deviation
between these values is also calculated to establish the reliance of correlations in future works.
After running this code, the saturation vapour pressure deviations in the range of DBT -60 C to 0 C is exported to a dat file 
- Saturation Pressure Deviations.dat for the detailed values and comparisons.
